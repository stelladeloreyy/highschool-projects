# High School Programming Projects

This repository contains projects created during high school as part of learning how to program for the first time. Each project was developed using [Processing](https://processing.org/) in Java

## Projects

- **Doodle Jump (doodle-jump-a5/)**: A recreation of the classic Doodle Jump game, featuring custom graphics and platform mechanics.
- **Space Invaders (space-invaders-a4/)**: A version of the iconic Space Invaders arcade game, with animated sprites and multiple difficulty levels.

## How to Run

1. Download and install [Processing](https://processing.org/download/).
2. Open the `.pde` file for the project you want to run (e.g., `Doodle_Jump_A5.pde` or `Space_Invaders_A4.pde`) in the Processing IDE.
3. Make sure the `assets` folder for each project is in the same directory as the `.pde` file.
4. Click the **Run** button in Processing to start the game.
